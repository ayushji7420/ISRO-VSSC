#TASK 1
In task 1, i have downloaded the fits file from Hubble Legacy Archives and this is the fits file for M42.
Afterwards i have done basic coding for the info and plotting the image of M42.
Then for making the CSV file i have trimmed out a small part of the plot, i have done so as taking the whole plots were leading a huge number of objects which was taking time as well for execution.
For identifying stars, galaxies and planets, i tried plotting luminosity vs object id and size vs object id. But was unable to predict anything.

#TASK 2
in task 2
